### Speedometer for CarPlay

The [Speedometer widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/car-play#speedometer) has also been added for CarPlay. The Speedometer widget is profile-dependent, so if you change the settings for one profile, they will not be applied to another.

## Turn-by-turn instructions

[Turn-by-turn information](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/route-details/#turn-by-turn-information) provides detailed instructions for navigating your route. These instructions include information about your movements along the route.

## Quick Actions Tool Update

The updated **Add Action** screen makes it easier to customize and add [*Quick actions*](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action), improving access to important features. You can now find groups of actions, use the search function, and apply other actions to customize the *Quick Actions tool*, contributing to a better user experience.

## Custom buttons

In this update, we've introduced Custom Buttons, a unique type of [Quick action](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#custom-buttons) tool. Users can now create a custom action button for their device's screen.

_Menu → Configure screen → Buttons → Custom buttons → + → Add button_

## 3D track updates

We have improved the [3D track appearance](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks-on-map/track-appearance#3d-track) and added more options for wall colors. You can now customize wall colors based on _Altitude, Slope, Speed, Heart Rate, Bicycle Cadence, Bicycle Power, Temperature_, and more.

## Multi-selection for My Tracks

[This menu item](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/manage-tracks#three-dots-menu) allows you [to select the folders and routes](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/manage-tracks#selection-mode) you need for further management.

_Menu → My Places → Tracks → &#8230; → Select_

## 3D My Location Icons

A new 3D view has been added for [My Location](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#profile-appearance) icons, which improves their visualization on the map. These changes bring the appearance of the icons in alignment with the 3D tilt of the map.

## Color Palettes

For this release you can use [(export/import) color palette](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/color-schemes) files for:

- [Terrain](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#hillshade-slope-and-altitude-layers): Hillshade, Slope.
- [Weather](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/weather#weather-layers): All weather layers.

Users can create and add their own color palettes. Simply compose your TXT file with the following names: _Terrain_ - `height_altitude_name.txt`, `hillshade_color_name.txt`, `slope_name.txt`, _Routes_ - `route_speed_name.txt`, `route_slope_default.txt`, `route_elevation_default.txt`, _Weather_ - `weather_name.txt`

Angle between Destination (Bearing from last point) and last segment (Bearing last 2 route points)  are measured and split in 3 sectors by 120 degree. 
* `-60 °` – `+60 °` = straight
* `-180 °` – `-60 °` = left
* `60 °` – `180 °` = right.

## Login to OpenStreetMap

As of June 1, 2024, only [the new secure OAuth 2.0 method](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-iOS/issues/3736) will be supported.  This authorization method provides a higher level of information security to help protect your data and prevent unauthorized access.
