### Speedometer for CarPlay

The [Speedometer widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/car-play#speedometer) has also been added for CarPlay. The Speedometer widget is profile-dependent, so if you change the settings for one profile, they will not be applied to another.

## Turn-by-turn instructions

[Turn-by-turn information](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/route-details/#turn-by-turn-information) provides detailed instructions for navigating your route. These instructions include information about your movements along the route.

## Custom buttons

In this update, we've introduced Custom Buttons, a unique type of [Quick action](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#custom-buttons) tool. Users can now create a custom action button for their device's screen.

_Menu → Configure screen → Buttons → Custom buttons → + → Add button_
