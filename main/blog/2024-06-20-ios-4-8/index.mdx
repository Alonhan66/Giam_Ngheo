### Speedometer for CarPlay

The [Speedometer widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/car-play#speedometer) has also been added for CarPlay. The Speedometer widget is profile-dependent, so if you change the settings for one profile, they will not be applied to another.

## Turn-by-turn instructions

[Turn-by-turn information](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/route-details/#turn-by-turn-information) provides detailed instructions for navigating your route. These instructions include information about your movements along the route.

## Custom buttons

In this update, we've introduced Custom Buttons, a unique type of [Quick action](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#custom-buttons) tool. Users can now create a custom action button for their device's screen.

_Menu → Configure screen → Buttons → Custom buttons → + → Add button_

## 3D track updates

We have improved the [3D track appearance](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks-on-map/track-appearance#3d-track) and added more options for wall colors. You can now customize wall colors based on _Altitude, Slope, Speed, Heart Rate, Bicycle Cadence, Bicycle Power, Temperature_, and more.

For this release you can use (export/import) color palette files for:

- [Terrain](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#hillshade--slope): Hillshade, Slope.
- [Weather](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/weather#weather-layers): All weather layers.

Users can create and add their own color palettes. Simply compose your TXT file with the following names: _Terrain_ - `height_altitude_name.txt`, `hillshade_color_name.txt`, `slope_name.txt`, _Routes_ - `route_speed_name.txt`, `route_slope_default.txt`, `route_elevation_default.txt`, _Weather_ - `weather_name.txt`
