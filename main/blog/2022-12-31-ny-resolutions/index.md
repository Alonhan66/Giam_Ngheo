Happy New 2023 Year!

<!--

At the end of each year, we sum up the results of the passing year and write our plans for the next one. This tradition started 5 years ago and we continue doing it each year. Sometimes our ambitions are not nearly completed, sometimes we overshoot the plan.
-->

<!--truncate-->


<!--
2022 was another difficult year for most of us, so it was for OsmAnd as well. Though we wish that 2 COVID years are over and we finally can go back to our normal traveling life with Maps. In our 2022 New Year resolutions we anticipated the difficulties and wrote a rather simple for our team list which we consider as 90% completed.

One of the biggest achievements of 2022 is that we‚Äôve managed to double our Team up to 20 people and this Team delivers features with quite an incredible pace.

## Summary
