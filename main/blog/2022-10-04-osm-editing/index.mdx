As part of the Peljesac Cartographic Test Site, a group of students under the supervision of Dr. Paweł Strusia and Dr. Krzysztof Wiedermann from the Geoinformation Research Laboratory of the University of Life Sciences in Krakow will learn about modern methods of obtaining data in the field and their digitization.

On behalf of the OpenStreetMap editors community, the event is attended by Włodzimierz Bartczak, OSMP vice-president, and Przemysław Boszczar, OSMP member and one of the most active editors. As part of the course, they will familiarize students with the OpenStreetMap data model, data editing tools and data entry principles.

As part of the project, students will collect data in the field, data on tourist infrastructure, including accommodation facilities, restaurants and vineyards located in the vicinity. Remotely analyze the available orthophotomap and on its basis update the data of land development, communication routes and buildings.

These data will be used to prepare a detailed tourist map of the peninsula (for the needs of the local community, tourist board, entrepreneurs, tourists), and later to prepare thematic maps for testing various methods of spatial analysis and conducting geodiversity research of the Peljesac peninsula, land use control, etc. The data will be included to OpenStreetMap resources.
