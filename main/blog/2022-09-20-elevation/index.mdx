Hi Everybody! 

In the last release of OsmAnd for Android, we added two Pro features with Elevation data.  

The Elevation widget shows a graph with the elevation and slope of your navigation route and your current location on this graph with the current altitude and slope. The graph is plotted on two axes. The X-axis is the distance of your route. The Y-axis is the altitude above sea level, the value of which depends on the relief, and the slope is displayed as a percentage.

The relief of the terrain has a great influence on the trip. Of course, it's very important to know what uphills and downhills await us on the way. In OsmAnd you can see [the Altitude graph](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/#route-details) when building a route. The graphs can be worked with both GPX tracks and routes.  

Our team has added two features for users of the Android version of the app with an [OsmAnd Pro](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#pro-features) subscription: Elevation widget and Online Elevation profile.  

Elevation widget is most useful for cycling and hiking activities.


## Contour lines and Terrain

:::note
Available for Android and iOS.
:::

Contour lines and relief are our first integrated features for the app to customize and display relief information. These features are available for both Android and iOS versions of the OsmAnd app. Read  about it in the [Contour lines Plugin](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines) article.

## Elevation graphs

:::note
Available for Android and iOS.
:::

During the navigation route building you are provided with Altitude and Slope data in the form of a [graph](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/#route-details), and with the ["Analyze on map"](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks-on-map#analyze-track-on-map) function you can find out additional, more detailed information about the route.

A detailed description of the graph you can find in the [Altitude section](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/track-context-menu#altitude) of the Track Context Menu article.

## Elevation widget

:::note
Available for Android only.
:::

The [Elevation widget](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/nav-widgets#elevation-widget) shows a graph with the elevation and slope of your navigation route and your current location on this graph with current altitude and slope. This is a paid feature for OsmAnd Pro subscribers.

## Online Elevation profile

:::note
Available for Android only.
:::

[Online Elevation profile](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/track-context-menu/#online-elevation-profile) is our paid OsmAnd Pro subscription feature. It allows you to calculate elevation profile for each points on your GPX track. The feature only works in online mode.

## Future features

:::note
Available for Android only.
:::

The OsmAnd team adds more and more features to the application. We try not to complicate the use of our product. Therefore, every user can enable or disable all the features so as not to overload the application and customize it to his or her needs as much as possible.  

The next version of OsmAnd for Android will include 3D relief. This will be a feature for offline use.  

How to start testing 3D relief right now:

1. Download and install: [OsmAnd OpenGL apk](https://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAnd-opengl-arm64-nightly.apk).
2. Enable Plugin: _OsmAnd Development → Settings → Use OpenGL rendering_ and _Heightmap_.
3. [Download maps](https://osmand.net/docs/user/start-with/download-maps) of regions *France-Italy Mediterranean (near the sea)*.
4. Adding 3D map file (first download and then click on it to open with OsmAnd app): [nicce.heightmap.sqlite](https://download.osmand.net/uploads/nicce.heightmap.sqlite)
5. Restart OsmAnd.
6. Enjoy it.

P.S. Of course, at first we are developing these features for the Android version. But in the second half of next year we will add them for the iOS version as well.
