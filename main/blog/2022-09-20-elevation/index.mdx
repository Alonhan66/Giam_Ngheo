Hi, Everybody! 

At the last release of OsmAnd for Android we added two Pro features with Elevation data.

The Elevation widget shows a graph with the elevation and slope of your navigation route and your current location on this graph with current altitude and slope. The graph is plotted on two axes. The X-axis is the distance of your route. The Y-axis is the altitude, the value depends on the relief, and the slope displayed as a percentage.

Relief has a great influence on our trip. Of course, it's very important to know what uphills and downhills wait for us on the way. In OsmAnd you can see [the Altitude graph](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/route-navigation#navigation-route) when you build your route. Working with graphs may be with GPX tracks or for routes. You can read about it here.

Now, our team added two features with this data for Android version and while for OsmAnd Pro users. These are Elevation widget and Online Elevation profile.

Elevation widget is very useful for cycling and hiking activities.
