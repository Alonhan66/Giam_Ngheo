## External sensors

For this release [External BLE sensors](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/external-sensors) were added for OsmAnd. 

Now you can add next external sensors to OsmAnd:

- **Heart Rate**. The heart rate sensor can transmit your heart rate in real time. This is useful for cycling training when you want to track your heart rate to optimize your training efforts.
- **Bicycle Power**. Your bike's power sensors measure the power you exert when you pedal. This allows you to analyze and optimize your workouts to improve efficiency and performance.
- **Bicycle Cadence**. Cadence is the number of pedal turns per minute. Cadence sensors help you maintain optimal pedaling speed for efficient cycling.
- **Bicycle Speed**. Speed sensors provide information about your current speed while cycling.
- **Bicycle Distance**. Distance sensors measure the distance you travel when you're driving.
- **Temperature**. The widget displays the ambient temperature, which can be very useful if you don't want to overheat or freeze on your bike or motorcycle.
