The release introduces support for [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/external-sensors), providing compatibility for a range of external sensors such as speed, cadence, distance, bicycle power, and pulse. This inclusion enhances the app’s capability to sync and display data from these external devices, catering to cycling enthusiasts and those using supplementary fitness equipment.   

You can add the following external sensors to the OsmAnd application:
- **Heart Rate**. The heart rate sensor can transmit your heart rate in real time. This is useful for cycling training when you want to track your heart rate to optimize your training efforts.
- **Bicycle Power**. Your bike's power sensors measure the power you exert when you pedal. This allows you to analyze and optimize your workouts to improve efficiency and performance.
- **Bicycle Cadence**. Cadence is the number of pedal turns per minute. Cadence sensors help you maintain optimal pedaling speed for efficient cycling.
- **Bicycle Speed**. Speed sensors provide information about your current speed while cycling.
- **Bicycle Distance**. Distance sensors measure the distance you travel when you're driving.
- **Temperature**. The widget displays the ambient temperature, which can be very useful if you don't want to overheat or freeze on your bike or motorcycle.


## Simple widget for Top / Bottom panel

## Travel Guides

| Download menu | Articles list |
|-------|------|
| ![wikivoyage](./img/wikivoyage_1.png) | ![wikivoyage](./img/wikivoyage_2.png) |

In this release, our team has added [Wikivoyage Travel Guides](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plan-route/travel-guides). You can now upload Wikivoyage items and articles to the OsmAnd map for your journey.
These virtual travel guides offer you valuable insights, recommendations and tips. They also allow travelers to get comprehensive navigational information about attractions right in the app.

- OsmAnd's travel guides are based on Wikivoyage, a Wikipedia-like community project where volunteer authors create up-to-date articles. Wikivoyage information includes basic facts about a place, transportation, attractions, and places to shop.  
- You can add wikivoyage points on the map or find it on *My Places → Tracks → Travel* menu.
