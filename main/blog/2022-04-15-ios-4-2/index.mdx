Hi!
We are glad to announce that iOS app version development does not stand still.
The new improved version is already available to install on you devices!
Every day we work to make the iOS version more filled and its functionality would be equal to the Android version. Inevitably, we face  bugs and mistakes on our way, that we try to fix immediately.
Thank you for your support and feedback.
