Hello everybody!

At this post I want to show my vision on OsmAnd kit for offroading by motorcycle and 4x4. 

In many cases you can use ordinary smartphone or tablet of course. And if speak about me, I mount my casual smartphone to bycycle wheel, or keep it on my pocket during hiking.



But for difficult conditions like vibration, dust, water you need to use special devices for these activities. Ordinary its are IP67 Tablet and External controller. Example how it looks like:


Maybe you saw stories from famous travellers where you can note special devices and OsmAnd as navigation app. Some of them it's Itchy Boots and Charly Sinewan.

Noraly - Itchy Boots on Africa.


On OsmAnd 4.6 we added new opportunities. For External input devices, now you can bind you actions for device buttons. For widgets you can use Top/Bottom panels, change widgets size and etc.

Start with OsmAnd 4.6 and 4.7, we gave a special offer for Tripltek devices - it's a free yearly subscription. Each Tripltek owner can install OsmAnd app and receive many Pro functions. This is a very powerful and secure IP67 device, with a very bright screen, on which you can see all the details on the map even in sunny weather.


Even I, as a user of the application for more than 10 years, was pleasantly surprised by the capabilities of the device; before that I used my iPhone. but in the bright sun it was impossible to see anything on the screen.

One of this Charly Sinewan and you can watch his movies with Tripltek and OsmAnd kit in his Youtube channel.
