Hi there!  
We are glad to announce the release of the iOS app version.  
Development doesn't stand still, and now the new improved version is available for installation on your devices! Every day, we work to make the iOS version more complete and as functional as the Android version. Inevitably, mistakes and bugs arise along our way, which we try to correct immediately. Thank you for your support and feedback.
