We are glad to announce that iOS version of OsmAnd is becoming better over time. We put significant efforts and managed to finish lots of useful features in a short period of time. Here is the short list of achievements.

<!--truncate-->

* We significantly improved the responsiveness of the map interaction.
* OsmAnd Maps now is also available for iPad.
* We added translations to Russian, German, Danish, French, Spanish and other languages (thanks to our great community). 
* Parking Position and Trip Recording addons were added to the application. Please feel free to use them without charge.
* In the new version you will be able to search a location by simply put the url or enter the coordinantes in the search text box.
* And lots of other minor and useful improvements.
