## Introduction

OsmAnd’s 3D GPX track feature adds a new dimension to navigation, allowing users to visualize routes with elevation changes in a three-dimensional view. This paid feature enhances route planning and exploration, making it ideal for outdoor enthusiasts looking to better understand the terrain.

## What is

In OsmAnd, a 3D GPX track not only displays the route's elevation but also offers additional data visualization, including speed, altitude, slope, and heart rate. This comprehensive view helps users analyze their performance and better understand the dynamics of their route in a realistic 3D environment.

## Why Use 3D GPX Tracks

The 3D GPX tracks feature in OsmAnd provides significant advantages for hikers, cyclists, and outdoor enthusiasts by offering a more detailed and immersive view of their routes. For hikers, the 3D visualization of elevation changes helps in understanding the difficulty of the terrain, allowing better preparation for steep climbs or descents. Cyclists benefit from seeing slope and altitude variations, aiding in route selection and pacing strategies. Outdoor enthusiasts, in general, can use the 3D view to assess the overall terrain and make informed decisions, enhancing safety and enjoyment during their activities. By visualizing additional data like speed and heart rate, users can also analyze performance and adjust their efforts to meet their goals. This makes the 3D GPX tracks in OsmAnd a valuable tool for anyone looking to optimize their outdoor adventures.

The 3D GPX track appearance can be useful in the following cases:

- **Elevation Analysis**: For hiking, cycling, or any outdoor activity where elevation changes are significant, a 3D view helps users better understand the terrain.

**Trail Visualization**: Mountain biking, skiing, or other sports enthusiasts can see the difficulty and steepness of trails.

**Route Planning**: Helps users plan routes by visualizing inclines and declines, making it easier to assess the challenge of a path.

**Training and Performance Tracking**: Athletes can use 3D views to review their performance on various elevations, aiding in training adjustments.

**Scenic Visualization**: For tourism or scenic routes, a 3D view enhances the visualization experience, making it more engaging.

**Navigation**: For advanced navigation systems, 3D visualization provides a clearer understanding of the landscape, aiding decision-making.

## How to Access the 3D GPX Track Feature

To access the 3D GPX track feature in OsmAnd, you need to have the **paid version** of the app, as this is a Pro subscription. Once you’ve upgraded, you can activate the 3D GPX track view by importing your GPX file into OsmAnd. Navigate to the map settings, and enable the 3D visualization option under the GPX track settings. You can then select the specific data you want to visualize, such as altitude, speed, or heart rate, and adjust the perspective to view your track in 3D. This setup allows you to fully utilize the enhanced features, providing a richer and more detailed navigation experience.

1. *Visualize by Speed with 3D*. One of the example is to use 3D track with Speed visualizations, so you can see what particular sections on the map caused slow down and speed up. With **Wall color** indication by **Slope** it's also possible to get an understanding how high hills impact the speed.

2. *Visualize by Heart sensor + 3D Relief*. Another interesting use case to visualize tracks by heart sensor data and get direct analysis on the map what was going on. With 3D relief enabled altitude will sum up with heart rate and could be useful in some scenarios. Please note that there are 2 Vertical exaggeration parameters and they work separately for 3D relief and for 3D track.

3. *Visualize Track height + Slope color line on flat earth*. If you visualize tracks by altitude then it's better to do on flat earth cause GPS errors of recorded altitude could hide track underground. In this use case you can visualize slope changes separately on the track line and wall color use for altitude.


## Conclusion

The 3D GPX track feature in OsmAnd offers a powerful way to visualize routes in a more realistic and informative manner. By incorporating elevation, speed, slope, and other data points into a 3D view, users gain a deeper understanding of the terrain and their performance, making it easier to plan and navigate routes effectively. Whether you’re a hiker, cyclist, or outdoor enthusiast, this feature enhances your experience, turning your maps into interactive tools that provide valuable insights and improve your overall journey.
