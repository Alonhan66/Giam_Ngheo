Happy New Year!

We have a good tradition every end of the year to write down New Year Resolutions for the next year and sum up the results of the past year ([Resolutions 2023](https://osmand.net/blog/ny-resolutions-2023)). It's already our 7th Resolutions. 


2023 was very difficult for our team though we stayed strong and #StandWithUkraine üá∫üá¶. Nevertheless, there is quite a lot to be proud of 2023 achievements.

In 2023 we launched the new OsmAnd website with new [documentation](https://osmand.net/docs/intro) and [map](https://osmand.net/map). We also introduced the Pro cross-platform subscription for iOS, Android, Web and finally released OpenGL Rendering for Android with 3D terrain.
