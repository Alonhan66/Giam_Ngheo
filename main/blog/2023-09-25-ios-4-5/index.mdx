### OsmAnd Start

For OsmAnd 4.5 was added [OsmAnd Start](./start) plan. A user should register an email for the [OsmAnd Cloud](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud) and then activate _OsmAnd Start_.

_OsmAnd Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud_

After that, you can [backup](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud#select-data-to-back-up) your [Profiles](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles), [favorites](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/favorites), [OSM Edits and Notes](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/osm-editing#create--modify-osm-note), and [OsmAnd settings](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles) for free.

Size of OsmAnd Free Cloud - 5 MB

### Topography and 3D Relief

We have added _Terrain map_ for countries in [Download maps](https://osmand.net/docs/user/start-with/download-maps) menu. This data type can be used to generate [Slopes, Hillshades (paid)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#free-and-paid-features), and 3D maps ([OsmAnd Pro](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#pro-features)).

Our updates:
- Renamed _Contour lines_ plugin to [_Topography_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines) plugin.
- Added support for the new [_Terrain map (3D)_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps#map-types) forma (it's a paid function). This map data is used for generated Slopes/Hillshades, 3D map view. Read more [here](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#terrain-map-data).
- Now, [Slope](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#slope-map) and [Hillshades](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#hillshade-map) are [generated from _Terrain map (3D)_ data](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#terrain).
- Added _3D Relief_(Paid function) for the map. Read more [here](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#3d-relief): _Menu → Configure map → Terrain → 3D Relief_.
- Redesigned [_Topography menu_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/configure-map-menu): _OsmAnd menu → Configure map → Topography: Contour lines, Terrain, Nautical depth_
- The new "3D/2D Mode" button for the map screen was added. Now you can make a map tilt not only with [two fingers](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map#gestures). "3D/2D Mode" button acts differently with menus and on map screens if _3D Mode_ in Configure Screen is set to Visible in 3D Mode.
_OsmAnd Menu → Configure Screen → Buttons → 3D Mode_:
  - Hidden
  - Visible
  - Visible in 3D mode
- Changed direction of titlt gesture

  ** **map tilt angle by button is the last tilt angle by two-finger gestures**

### New Configure Screen

Two sections: _Widgets_ and _Buttons_


![Configure Screen](./img/screen.png)


### Widget updates

We've done a lot of work on the widgets and interface of the Configure screen:
- We redesigned the Configure screen, separating the widgets from the buttons, and spacing the different widget panels more clearly.
- Added pages for widgets.
- Duplicates.
- Combined the widgets from the left, right, top and bottom panels.

#### Pages and Duplicates for widgets 

Widgets in the Left panel and Right panel can be grouped into Pages.
_OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets (Left / Right panel) → Edit → Add pages_

You can show Duplicates for the right/left panels at the same time, as well as for each page of widgets.
_OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets (Left / Right panel) → Edit → Add widget_


#### Average speed widget

The new Average speed widget shows the average speed of the current ride:

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Average speed_


The average speed is calculated for the specified time interval. Click on the "Settings" button of the Average Speed widget to select the time interval for which the average speed will be measured:

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Average speed → Interval/Take stops into account_

#### Trip recording widgets

Added new widgets for "Trip recording". Trip recording now consists of 4 separate widgets:

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Trip recording_

* **Distance/Start-Stop**: starts or stops trip recording and shows distance of the currently recorded trip. Clickable widget.
* **Duration**: shows the duration in minutes/hours of the currently recorded trip.
* **Uphill**: shows the sum of all climbs of the current recorded trip.
* **Downhill**: shows the sum of all descents of the current recorded trip.


#### True bearing widget

Added new widgets for "Bearing". Bearing now has 3 separate widgets:

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Bearing_

* **Relative bearing** is the angle between your forward movement direction and the target point.
* **Magnetic bearing** is the clockwise (horizontal) angle between the magnetic north and the target point observed from your location.
* **True bearing** is expressed as the horizontal angle between the geographic meridian and a line on Earth. Specifically, true point bearing is the angle measured in degrees clockwise from the True North line.


### Updates for Configure Map 

Added [CAI (Club Alpino Italiano)](https://www.cai.it/) scale for routes [difficulty classification](https://montanarilife.com/2016/07/03/hiking-trail-rating-systems-italy/):

_OsmAnd Menu → Configure map → Routes → Difficulty classification_
