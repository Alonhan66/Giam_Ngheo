### OsmAnd Start

For OsmAnd 4.5 was added [OsmAnd Start](./start) plan. A user should register an email for the [OsmAnd Cloud](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud) and then activate _OsmAnd Start_.

_OsmAnd Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud_

After that, you can [backup](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud#select-data-to-back-up) your [Profiles](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles), [favorites](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/favorites), [OSM Edits and Notes](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/osm-editing#create--modify-osm-note), and [OsmAnd settings](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles) for free.

Size of OsmAnd Free Cloud - 5 MB

### New Relief format

We have added _Terrain map_ for countries in [Download maps](https://osmand.net/docs/user/start-with/download-maps) menu. This data type can be used to generate [Slopes, Hillshades (paid)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#free-and-paid-features), and 3D maps ([OsmAnd Pro](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#pro-features)).

Our updates:
- Renamed _Contour lines_ plugin to [_Topography_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines) plugin.
- Added support for the new [_Terrain map (3D)_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps#map-types) forma (it's a paid function). This map data is used for generated Slopes/Hillshades, 3D map view. Read more [here](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#terrain-map-data).
- Now, [Slope](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#slope-map) and [Hillshades](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#hillshade-map) are [generated from _Terrain map (3D)_ data](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#terrain).
- Added _3D Relief_(Paid function) for the map. Read more [here](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#3d-relief): _Menu → Configure map → Terrain → 3D Relief_.
- Redesigned [_Topography menu_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/configure-map-menu): _OsmAnd menu → Configure map → Topography: Contour lines, Terrain, Nautical depth_
- The new "3D/2D Mode" button for the map screen was added. Now you can make a map tilt not only with [two fingers](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map#gestures). "3D/2D Mode" button acts differently with menus and on map screens if _3D Mode_ in Configure Screen is set to Visible in 3D Mode.
_OsmAnd Menu → Configure Screen → Buttons → 3D Mode_:
  - Hidden
  - Visible
  - Visible in 3D mode
- Changed direction of titlt gesture

  ** **map tilt angle by button is the last tilt angle by two-finger gestures**

_OsmAnd Menu → Configure map → Routes → Difficulty classification_
