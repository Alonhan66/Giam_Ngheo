### OsmAnd Start

For OsmAnd 4.5 was added [OsmAnd Start](./start) plan. A user should register an email for the [OsmAnd Cloud](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud) and then activate _OsmAnd Start_.

_OsmAnd Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Cloud_

After that, you can [backup](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/osmand-cloud#select-data-to-back-up) your [Profiles](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles), [favorites](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/favorites), [OSM Edits and Notes](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/osm-editing#create--modify-osm-note), and [OsmAnd settings](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles) for free.

Size of OsmAnd Free Cloud - 5 MB

### Topography and 3D Relief

We have added _Terrain map_ for countries in [Download maps](https://osmand.net/docs/user/start-with/download-maps) menu. This data type can be used to generate [Slopes, Hillshades (paid)](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#free-and-paid-features), and 3D maps ([OsmAnd Pro](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#pro-features)).

Our updates:
- Renamed _Contour lines_ plugin to [_Topography_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines) plugin.
- Added support for the new [_Terrain map (3D)_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps#map-types) forma (it's a paid function). This map data is used for generated Slopes/Hillshades, 3D map view. Read more [here](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#terrain-map-data).
- Now, [Slope](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#slope-map) and [Hillshades](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#hillshade-map) are [generated from _Terrain map (3D)_ data](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#terrain).
- Added _3D Relief_(Paid function) for the map. Read more [here](https://osmand.net/blog/terrain#3d-relief): _Menu → Configure map → Terrain → 3D Relief_.
- Redesigned [_Topography menu_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/configure-map-menu): _OsmAnd menu → Configure map → Topography: Contour lines, Terrain, Nautical depth_
- The new "3D/2D Mode" button for the map screen was added. Now you can make a map tilt not only with [two fingers](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map#gestures). "3D/2D Mode" button acts differently with menus and on map screens if _3D Mode_ in Configure Screen is set to Visible in 3D Mode.
_OsmAnd Menu → Configure Screen → Buttons → 3D Mode_:
  - Hidden
  - Visible
  - Visible in 3D mode
- Changed direction of titlt gesture

  ** **map tilt angle by button is the last tilt angle by two-finger gestures**

### New Configure Screen

Configure Screen menu was devided on Two sections: _Widgets_ and _Buttons_

- On [_Widgets_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#widget-panels) section, you can add or remove widgets on a screen device and switch on/off _Transparent_ function for them. Read more about new widget updates [on this article](#widget-updates).
- On [_Buttons_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen#buttons) section, you add on a device screen and set parameters for Compass, Quick Action, 3D mode buttons  and switch on/off _Distance by tap_ function.

### Widget updates

We've done a lot of work on the widgets and interface of [the Configure screen](#new-configure-screen):
- We redesigned the Configure screen, separating the widgets from the buttons, and spacing the different widget panels more clearly.
- Added pages for widgets.
- Duplicates.
- Combined the widgets from the left, right, top and bottom panels.

#### Pages and Duplicates for widgets 

Widgets in the _Left_ panel and _Right_ panel can be grouped into Pages.

You can show Duplicates for the right/left panels at the same time, as well as for each page of widgets.

_OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets (Left / Right panel) → Edit → Add widget/Add page_


|Configure screen menu| Widgets and buttons on a screen|
|------|------|
|![Widgets](./img/widget-1.png)| ![Widgets](./img/widget-2.png)|

Additional settings menu for widget panels:

_OsmAnd menu → Configure screen → Widgets (panels) → "..." button → Reset to default/Copy from another profile/Help_


#### Average speed widget

The new Average speed widget shows the average speed of the current ride:

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Average speed_


The average speed is calculated for the specified time interval. Click on the "Average speed" button to select the time interval for which the average speed will be measured:

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Average speed → Interval/Take stops into account_

![Average speed](./img/average_speed.png)

#### True bearing widget

Added new widgets for "Bearing". Bearing now has 3 separate widgets:

_Menu → Configure screen → Widgets → Left / Right panel → Bearing_

* **Relative bearing** is the angle between your forward movement direction and the target point.
* **Magnetic bearing** is the clockwise (horizontal) angle between the magnetic north and the target point observed from your location.
* **True bearing** is expressed as the horizontal angle between the geographic meridian and a line on Earth. Specifically, true point bearing is the angle measured in degrees clockwise from the True North line.


### Updates for Configure Map 

Added [CAI (Club Alpino Italiano)](https://www.cai.it/) scale for routes [difficulty classification](https://montanarilife.com/2016/07/03/hiking-trail-rating-systems-italy/):

_OsmAnd Menu → Configure map → Routes → Difficulty classification_

![Class](./img/class.png)

### OSM authorization through OAuth

### More

- Fixed issue with favorites export, that could lead to data loss
- Added "Announce deviation from the route" for [Voice prompts](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/guidance/navigation-settings#voice-prompts)
