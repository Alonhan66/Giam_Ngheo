## New terrain colorization

New colorizations for [terrain](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#color-scheme) schemes have been added.

Users can now create and add their own color palettes for terrain. Simply compose your TXT file with the following names: `height_altitude_name`, `hillshade_color_name`, `slope_name`.

*height_altitude_0-200.txt*

```
# 0 - 90 degree RGBA
0,46,185,0,191
# yellow 
100,255,222,2,227
# red
200,255,1,1,255
# violet
220,130,1,255,255

```
After moving the TXT file to _..Android/data/net.osmand/files/color-paletee/height_altitude_0-200.txt_, new palettes will appear in the Colour Scheme menu.
