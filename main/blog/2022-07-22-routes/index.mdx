Hi, Everybody! 

There are thousand official and nonofficial travel routes which symbols (marks) you can see in cities, forests and etc. All these routes are travel routes for your activities. Many of them there are in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and you look at them online [here](https://waymarkedtrails.org/), for example.

## Routes in OsmAnd

In OsmAnd you can highlight routes (present on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)) and [hiking symbol](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Trail_markings) overlay for your activities. It is very useful for your cycling, hiking, etc. You can select multiple routes at once though they will be displayed as layers and if the road has multiple routes over it only top colour will be visible. If you have some specific rendering styles enabled, you could have a bigger routes variety i.e. for Snowmobile style you could select Snowmobile routes.

**<Translate android="true" ids="android_button_seq"/>** *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,configure_map,rendering_category_routes"/>*

### Choosing routes in OsmAnd

:::note

While this feature works only for Android version of OsmAnd.

:::

[Hiking / Cycling / Travel routes](http://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#routes) are clickable. Just tap **the route symbol**, get full route information and download the GPX file for the selected route. (Routes are marked on the map with [OSMC symbols](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:osmc:symbol).)

Clicking on a shield ([OSMC symbols](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:osmc:symbol)) proposes to choose the nearest routes.

Choosing the route opens [Track Context menu](../../docs/user/map/track-context-menu.md):

You can view the route, its relief, download it as a GPX-file, edit it by "Plan route" tool and even start navigation along it.:
- look at Route info (Distance, Uphill, Downhill, Altitude range, Route name, Network, Operator etc.). 

![Routes on the ground](./routes-6.png)
