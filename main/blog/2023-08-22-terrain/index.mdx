Hello everybody!

In the [OsmAnd 4.5 release](https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-android-4-5-released#terrain-maps-updates), a new terrain map type has been added. This is a new data type in our application, which is needed for terrain rendering, and for some additional functions related to elevations. All the information is in our [documentation](https://osmand.net/docs/user/), but in this article, we will describe how and what you can see and get on the screen with a new data type.

   &#9755;  Let's go!

<!-- alternative text
Let us introduce you to a useful and informative solution for working with these data types.  
First, take a look at these screenshots:

On them, you can see 3D relief and slopes using vector and raster maps. The widget shows Elevation in the center of the screen. 

This is an example of the *possibilities* of terrain data, and that's not all.

<!-- alternative text
The following are the benefits that make this solution an excellent choice:

- ðŸŒŸ Compact file size. Does not require a lot of space on your device. 
- ðŸŒ„ Variety of data displays.  OsmAnd allows you to choose several display options. Imagine the realism of data display as if you were exploring different worlds - from spectacular hills to steep slopes and exciting 3D relief.
- ðŸ”Œ Autonomous use. This is one of the important features. No dependence on internet connection, no restrictions wherever you are.
-->

**Benefits**:

- The download file has a **small size**.
- Ability to display different **types of data** on the map: *Hillshades*, *Slopes*, and *3D relief*.
- You can use this in **offline mode**.


## Terrain map data

The Terrain map data is [a paid function](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#free-and-paid-features), to get it you need:

- Purchase one of the OsmAnd paid packages available: Hillshades/Slopes for *OsmAnd+*, *OsmAnd Maps+*, and 3D Relief with [OsmAnd Pro subscription](https://osmand.net/docs/user/purchases/android#pro-features).
- [Download](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#how-to-download) Terrain map data from *Menu â†’ Download maps â†’ Regions â†’ Selected country â†’ Terrain map (3D)*. 


## Topography menu

After downloading the Terrain map data, the next step is to activate [*Terrain*](#terrain) and [*3D Relief*](#3d-relief) for your map.   
Go to: *Menu â†’ Configure map â†’ Topography*

![Menu](./img/topography_menu.png)  


### Terrain 

The Terrain menu enables and configures two parameters: [_Hillshade_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#hillshade) and [_Slope_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#slope).

This is how the two types of terrain, Hillshade and Slope, look on the map:  

|Hillshade|Slope|
|------|-------|
|![Hillshade](./img/hillshade.png)|![Slope](./img/slope.png)|


How to choose a colour scheme and other parameters for layers read below.

Choose your terrain parameter _OsmAnd menu â†’ Configure map â†’ Topography â†’ Terrain â†’ **Colour scheme**_:

- _Hillshade_ allows you to explore the topography by illuminating it with hypothetical lighting which simulates shading, thus revealing relief.

- _Slope_ allows you to explore the steepness (incline) of slopes expressed in degrees of deviation from the horizontal.

|Colour scheme - Hillshade|Colour scheme - Slope|
|------|-------|
|![Hillshade](./img/hillshade_menu.png)|![Slope](./img/slope_menu.png)|

**_Visibility_** is a parameter for transparency of the colors used to display the angle (Slope) and the shading (Hillshade). 

|Visibility 31%|Visibility 74%|
|------|-------|
|![Visibility ](./img/31.png)|![Visibility ](./img/74.png)|


**_Zoom levels_** is a parameter for setting the minimum and maximum zoom levels at which the layer will be displayed.

![Zoom](./img/zoom.png)

**_Cache size_** is a parameter that shows the size of the cache. Each time you view terrain info on the map (hillshade or slope), all this data is cached for quick use in the future (no additional load on the device processor).

Clear the cache: _System settings â†’ Apps â†’ OsmAnd â†’ Storage â†’ Clear cache_

### 3D relief

The [3D Relief feature](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/contour-lines#3d-relief) produces a raised relief and provides a three-dimensional representation of the landscape. 3D Relief works offline and can be used with [OsmAnd vector maps](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps.md) or any  [raster maps](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/raster-maps.md#select-raster-maps) as a [Map Source](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/raster-maps.md#main) or as an [Underlay/Overlay](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/raster-maps.md#overlay-layer).

To enable 3D Relief, go to _Menu â†’ Configure map â†’ Topography â†’ 3D Relief_ and toggle on.

![Menu](./img/topography_menu.png)

Now, you can see 3D Relief (offline) on the map with any map layers:

|Vectom map layer|Raster map layer|
|------|-------|
|![3D](./img/3d.png)|![3D](./img/3d_2.png)|


## Widget

With **Terrain map data** you can view the altitude for *each point* on the map.

To display [*Elevation: map center*](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#-elevation-map-center) widget, add it on the device screen:  
*Menu â†’ Configure screen â†’ Left / Right panel â†’ Altitude*.

|Widget settings screen|Widgets on the screen|
|------|-------|
|![Widget](./img/widget0.png)|![Widget](./img/widget1.png)|


## Calculation elevation
The next function, *Calculation elevation*, allows you to offline calculate terrain elevation from Terrain map data for any GPX tracks that do not contain elevation data for any points on the map:  
[*Track Context menu â†’ Track â†’ Altitude â†’ Calculate elevation â†’ Calculate offline*](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/track-context-menu#altitude). 

|Before|After|
|------|-------|
|![Elevation](./img/elevation0.png)|![Elevation](./img/elevation1.png)|
