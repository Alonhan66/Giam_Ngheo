Hello everybody!

In the [OsmAnd 4.5 release](https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-android-4-5-released#terrain-maps-updates), a new type of terrain maps has been added. This is a new type of data in our application, which is needed for terrain rendering, as well as for some additional functions related to elevations. All the information is in our [documentation](https://osmand.net/docs/user/), but in this article we will describe how and what can be seen and received on the screen with a new data type.

At first, look at this screenshots:

At this images you can see 3D relief, Slopes with vector and raster maps. Widget shows Elevation on the screen center. 

This is an example of the possibilities of terrain data and that's not all.

**Advantages**:
- small download size.
- possibility of different display for data: hillshades, slopes, 3D relief.
- offline using.
