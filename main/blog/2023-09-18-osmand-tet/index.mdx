### TET

TET (Trans Euro Trail) is an 80.000km GPX route from the edge of Africa to the Artic Circle. Created by TET adventure motorcycle community.

### Import TET route

Often there is question where to get TET route. Only source for correct and valid GPX file that holds full route is [Trans Euro Trail own web page](https://transeurotrail.org/). Go there with your mobile and select country and hit Download gpx button and accept terms and rules. Once gpx file is downloaded open it and you should see OsmAnd as possible application to open file.

Once application is opened you will see information about gpx file. This gpx file was containing 13 separate tracks and you can choose what tracks are imported or all. Click Import 13/13 button to import selected tracks.

| Download TET route   | Open it by OsmAnd    | Import tracks screen in OsmAnd    |
|----|-----|-----|
|![Import](./img/fin-2.png)|![Import](./img/fin-3.png)|![Import](./img/fin-4.png)|

If tracks are not visible right away after import you need to make those visible from menu:

_OsmAnd Menu → Configure map → [Tracks](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks-on-map#tracks-in-configure-map-menu)_

You will see all tracks that are available in application. Select the ones that you imported and press OK.

|    |     |     |
|----|-----|-----|
|![Import](./img/fin-5.png)|![Import](./img/fin-6.png)| ![Import](./img/fin-7.png)|

 Now you can see that Tracks count is updated and when you press back button you will see routes in map.

|     |     |

|![Import](./img/fin-8.png)| ![Import](./img/fin-9.png)|

### Start navigation

[Navigation](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/gpx-navigation) is started by clicking the track that you want to follow. Once you click track menu will open that tells basic information about track like name and distance etc.

There are 4 main buttons that are from left to right: _Hide track from map_, _Change colors_, _Edit track_, _Navigate_. Click Navigate button. You will see direction of route in next screen.

| Tap on a track  | Follow track   |
|----|-----|
|![Navigation](./img/fin-10.png)|![Navigation](./img/fin-11.png)|

Quite often you might need to change direction if you are in not located in place where the track starts. This can be done by pressing options (gear icon top of Start button). Then click close. 

Then select [follow track](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/setup/gpx-navigation#follow-track-menu) and click Reverse track direction.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|![Follow track](./img/fin-12.png)|![Follow track](./img/fin-13.png)| 

Now you can see that track arrows are pointing other direction.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|![Follow track](./img/fin-14.png)| ![Follow track](./img/fin-15.png)| 

Now we can start navigation by pressing start button.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|![Follow track](./img/fin-16.png)|![Follow track](./img/fin-17.png)|


### Creating profile

OsmAnd is only application that allows you [to create profile](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles) that will route you trough gravel roads always when possible. This will give great twist for planning trips. Just click the location on the map and then select navigate then app will do the rest.

So how to do that? hit _the OsmAnd menu_ and select _Settings_:

1. Scroll page down
2. _New profile_.
3. Base profile is _Motorcycle_. Give new name for Profile. Select colour and icon press _Save_ button.

|  Settings menu | _New Profile_ button   |  New Profile screen  |
|----|-----|-----|
|![Profile](./img/fin-18.png)|![Profile](./img/fin-19.png)| ![Profile](./img/fin-20.png)|

Now we have new profile, but we need to edit it to meet our expectations. This tutorial expects that you want to drive **gravel roads**. But you can modify all settings as you want.

Click [_Navigation settings_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#navigation-settings) and then _Route parameters_:

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|![Import](./img/fin-21.png)|![Import](./img/fin-22.png)|

Remove _Fastest route_ setting so application routes you alternative routes. We want to avoid motorways (_No motorways_) but other roads are OK. Then we want to _Prefer unpaved roads_ so we turn that on.

|     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|
|![Import](./img/fin-23.png)| ![Import](./img/fin-24.png)| ![Import](./img/fin-25.png)|


Then press back so you go back to the map. Now you can click top left corner where is _Profile_ icon. Select newly created profile. You can see what tracks are visible etc. 

(Change Profile order on the list: _OsmAnd menu → Settings → Edit Profile list_)

|  |    |       |
|-----|-----|------|
|![Import](./img/fin-26.png)|![Import](./img/fin-27.png)| ![Import](./img/fin-28.png)|

When you go to map and click some place in the map and then press navigate it will follow your new Profile settings and creates route with given parameters.

|     |      |

### Configure screen

One important thing between profiles is that you can easily change what you want to see in map. It might very that if you ride bigger roads you might want to see speed limit indicator and you might want to see your current speed etc, When you are off roading it might not be so relevant information. Lets say we want to remove speed information from screen for this _Dualsport_ profile.

So Lets do following:
1. go to _OsmAnd Menu_
2. Click _Settings_
3. Click the profile that you want to edit
4. Click [_Configure screen_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles#configure-screen)

| |    |    |
|----|-----|-----|
|![Configure screen](./img/fin-31.png)|![Configure screen](./img/fin-32.png)| ![Configure screen](./img/fin-33.png)|


:::note
I also wanted to highlight [_Configure map_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/configure-map-menu) if you want to use different map for this profile than what other profiles are using it can be done from there.
:::

Now we can see that there are several panels where we have different type of [widgets](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/). As [_Current speed_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/info-widgets#current-speed) was in right panel lets click it. Now we can see all widgets that are set for right panel. Order can be changed and more can be added by clicking _Edit_ button in bottom of page. If we just want to remove one widget you can press it and then select Remove from widget information page.

|     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|
|![Configure screen](./img/fin-34.png)|![Configure screen](./img/fin-35.png)| ![Configure screen](./img/fin-36.png)|

One thing that I want to Highlight is [_Compass_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/map-buttons#compass). I had problem that map was not pointing up when I was navigating and I didn’t see compass button. Or sometimes I was able to see it and then it get lost and I could not understand what was the issue. So I recommend that _Compass_ is set [always visible](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/map-buttons#display-options) so you can easily select how you want your map behave while navigating.

| |    |
|----|-----|
|![Configure screen](./img/fin-37.png)|![Configure screen](./img/fin-38.png)|

After changes go back to the map and _Speed_ widget display has disappeared and if you take another profile it is visible there. So profiles are pretty powerful tool to use OsmAnd for all kind of purposes.

### Trip recording

[Trip recording](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording) in OsmAnd is not activated by default. Feature is available under [_Plugins_ menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/).

|    |    |
|----|-----|
|![Trip recording](./img/fin-39.png)|![Trip recording](./img/fin-40.png)|



|     |     |      |
|-----|-----|------|
| ![Trip recording](./img/fin-41.png)| ![Trip recording](./img/fin-42.png)| ![Trip recording](./img/fin-43.png)|

Once the Plugin is enabled there is new item in _Settings_ menu:

|    |     |
|----|-----|
|![Trip recording](./img/fin-44.png)|![Trip recording](./img/fin-45.png)| 

Click _Start_ button and once you have done recording select save from notification bar. You can view recorded route in map by selecting show on map and open a track.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
| ![Trip recording](./img/fin-46.png)| ![Trip recording](./img/fin-47.png)|


### Change basemap

You might prefer other [_Basemap_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/raster-maps#main) than default OsmAnd one. You can change suitable map from settings. Select Install more to easily install new maps or select _Add_ if you have specific source for maps.

:::note
1. You need to activate [_Online maps_ plugin](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/online-map).
2. Read more about additional map sources [here](https://osmand.net/blog/raster-maps).
:::


|     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|![Base map](./img/fin-48.png)|![Base map](./img/fin-49.png)| ![Base map](./img/fin-50.png)| ![Base map](./img/fin-51.png)|

It is also possible to set any map as [_Underlay_](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/map/raster-maps/#underlay-layer) or [_Overlay_](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/map/raster-maps/#overlay-layer) map. This allows you to mix good sides in several maps. I recommend to play with these settings to find exactly right settings for you. Usually default is good enough.


### Removing automatic centering 

[Automatic centering](https://docs.osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/guidance/navigation-settings#map-during-navigation) is good to have, but once I purchased [Silverfox bluetooth controller](https://www.silverfoxcontrollers.com/) I have disabled this feature. While I use controller I don’t want screen to center itself when I look possible routes ahead. I was using default timer that was 15 sec for automatic centering. That can be changed from same place if you don’t want to disable whole feature.

So how to do it? Click menu open and follow screenshot guidance, notice that this is profile based setting so you can enable it for driving mode and disable from Motorbike profiles.

### How soon application should reroute

Many might have noticed that if you follow TET route it is not following roads as it is just a track that should be followed without road navigation. Anyway I like to see where to turn next so I use navigation in TET tracks. Some times OsmAnd wants to start recalculating route if actual Line goes too far away from road that you should ride.

Here we have one example inside of red box When you follow road, but line that you navigate goes away from road OsmAnd might want to recalculate new route to get back to where you dropped from line. This causes quite unneeded updates in UI and if you have navigation commands on to helmet headset you might also get recalculate audio information. 

So to avoid this it is good to add more flex when OsmAnd is thinking that you are in wrong place.

| |
|----|
|![Reroute](./img/fin-58.png)| 

You can modify route recalculation settings under profile. Once again it is profile that specifies how OsmAnd works. So you can have different settings when you go with car and different when motorbiking. I have used 500m to trigger recalculation, but you can check what works for you. It is also possible to disable whole recalculation from same place, but I like to keep it on.

|![Reroute](./img/fin-62.png)|![Reroute](./img/fin-63.png)| ![Reroute](./img/fin-64.png)|


### Web Planner

Osmand has also launched web planner that can be found from [www.osmand.net/map](https://osmand.net/map) to get all out of it, pro subscription is needed, but basic are working with free account too. This is still quite simply, but hopefully we see progress on this planner and same filter (prefer gravel roads) to web too what we have in mobile side.


### Custom map types

Outdoor explorer Plugin allows you to see road surface. Information is taken from open street map so also contribution to it is pretty easy.

You can find this plugin and setup guide from here: https://github.com/cmoffroad/osmand-outdoor-explorer-plugin

I noticed issue when I was trying to use Samsung own “My files” application to open plugin file, but when I installed total commander installation was ok.
