The *[osmand.net/map](https://osmand.net/map/)* site is currently being developed and tested.  
**Therefore, the layout and operation of some functions on the site may be different from those described in this article.**   

We created the [Discussion theme](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/discussions/16567) on our GitHub so you can leave feedback there.
