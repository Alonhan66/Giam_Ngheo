## Overview

Сrash logs serve as valuable diagnostic tools that help developers identify and troubleshoot issues or bugs that cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. There are multiple possibilities to share logs from your Android device with OsmAnd development team. As of now, IOS users can send only one type of crash logs.  

## Crash and logcat logs
 
From the OsmAnd you can send to the developers two types of data:
- Crash logs (crash reports or crash dumps). They are generated when the OsmAnd app encounters a critical error or exception that causes it to crash. These logs contain detailed information about the state of the application at the time of the failure, including build data, stack trace, error messages, and other important data.
- Logcat logs. It is a record of a generated by OsmAnd log stream that captures various events and messages. Developers can use logcat logs to monitor app behavior, track the flow of execution, trace specific actions, and investigate issues that might not result in a crash but still require analysis. This file usually contains records of activity since it was last started.

<!--
Crash logs specifically focus on capturing information related to crashes and exceptions, while logcat logs offer a broader scope of system and application-level logging, including debugging and informational messages. Both types of logs are valuable tools for developers when it comes to troubleshooting and improving the stability and performance of the OsmAnd app.

:::caution
Be careful when sending logcat log files, while they may contain some sort of private information: the device's location, search and route building results, navigation data.

### Send logs from OsmAnd app (Android)

1. Go to *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_help,send_crash_log"/> (<Translate android="true" ids="send_logcat_log"/>)*. Depending on your situation, select the appropriate type of log. The difference between them is described [above](#crash-and-logcat-logs-android).
2. In the pop-up menu, choose Gmail or your mailing app. The letter will be generated automatically.

### Send logs from iOS devices

Logs from iOs devices can be sent only manualy.

1. Chose iOS system app Files → On my iPhone (or On my iPad) → OsmAnd Maps → Logs.
2. Select the file you want to send (file name contains the date when it was created) and in the pop-up menu, tap share.
3. Next, using your email program, we recommend sending the logs to crash@osmand.net.

## Send logs from adb terminal

:::note
Only for advanced users!
:::

In some (difficult, unusual) cases, tombstone files may be needed. Tombstone files serve as essential diagnostic tools for native code debugging and troubleshooting on the Android platform.

### Using adb

* Connect Android device or emulator to your computer.  

* Open terminal and call command:  
```adb bugreport ./output.zip```  
where output.zip - name of result file  

* Unzip result file:  
```unzip file.zip -d destination_folder```  

* Find tombstones folder:  
```cd FS/data/tombstones```
Where you find files like *tombstone_00* *tombstone_01* with raw text format. Just send them to email: crash@osmand.net

### Using rooted devices or Android Studio emulator

If you have root access on your device you can directly open folder */data/tommbstones*.  
In Android Studio you can open *"Device File Explorer"*, choose opened emulator and open folder /data/tommbstones.  
In folder you can see files like *tombstone_00* *tombstone_01* with raw text format. Just download them and and send to email crash@osmand.net
