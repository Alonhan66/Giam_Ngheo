## Overview

:::tip NOTE
To be able to use the iOS version of the OsmAnd app in CarPlay, you must purchase a [paid subscription]((../purchases/ios.md#free-and-paid-features)).
:::

OsmAnd is available for [*CarPlay*](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/) functions in your vehicle. You can connect your iOS device to the vehicle's multimedia system screen and use OsmAnd to navigate.  

<!--  

CarPlay is software developed by Apple that allows iPhone owners to use some functions of their phone on the screen of a car connected to the CarPlay system.

With CarPlay, users can access the OsmAnd app on their iPhone without picking up their phone. Instead, users can control apps from the car's screen or on the device with the app.

To use CarPlay, a compatible iPhone must be connected to the car's multimedia system using a Lightning cable or wirelessly via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. CarPlay is available on some vehicle models and requires the appropriate equipment.

To use CarPlay and the navigation apps on your vehicle's screen, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your iPhone is compatible with CarPlay and your vehicle supports this technology. As a general rule, if your vehicle was manufactured after 2014, it most likely supports CarPlay.
2. Connect your iPhone to your vehicle's multimedia system using a Lightning cable or via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
3 If your vehicle is equipped with CarPlay, the CarPlay interface should automatically appear on your vehicle's screen. If not, select the CarPlay option on your vehicle's screen.
4. To use OsmAnd, select it on the CarPlay screen. A map is displayed with routes and destinations marked on it.
5. To create a route, you must enter a destination on the CarPlay screen or in the app.
6. The navigation app provides information about your current position on the map, driving directions, distance to the next turn, and arrival time at your destination.
7. You can use voice prompts to listen to route guidance, report problems on the road, and find the nearest gas station.
  -->

## Setup

First, you need to select and configure the profile to be used when connecting to Android Auto or CarPlay. You can read how to configure a profile in the article [Profiles (Settings)](../personal/profiles).  

:::note
For quick access to the list of profiles available for connecting to CarPlay, the iOS version of the OsmAnd app has a separate item *Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Settings → CarPlay Profile*.

To use CarPlay in a vehicle compatible with this system, follow these steps:

1. Connect your iPhone to the car multimedia system using a Lightning cable or wirelessly via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The first connection may require permission to use CarPlay on the iPhone.
2. Once connected, the CarPlay menu will appear on the vehicle screen with all available apps.
To use a navigation application such as Apple Maps, select it from the CarPlay menu. Then enter the address or name of the place you want to get to. You can also use Siri voice commands to search and navigate.
4. Once you've selected a location, press Start or Go to start your route.
5. As you drive, the vehicle screen will display detailed route instructions, including turns, distances, and arrival times.
6. If you want to change your route or select a different location, you can use Siri voice commands or press the appropriate buttons on the screen.
7. After completing a route, you can disconnect CarPlay by disconnecting your iPhone from the vehicle's multimedia system.

Please note that an Internet connection may be required to use the navigation apps in CarPlay. If Internet access on your iPhone is limited, you can use applications such as Google Maps or Waze, which allow you to preload maps and routes and use them without the Internet.

### POI categories

You can select one needed [POI](../map/point-layers-on-map.md#points-of-interest-poi) from the list of available categories. POI is a type of points that are highlighted on the map by special icons provided in the application settings, and sorted into groups.  

<!-- To navigate to a POI (point of interest) in CarPlay, follow these simple steps:

1. Connect your iPhone to CarPlay in your car and start OsmAnd.
2. Enter the name of the POI you want to find using voice search or on-screen text input.
3. When the app finds the POI you're looking for, select it on the map or in the list of search results.
4. Tap the "Directions" or "Itinerary" button to start navigating to that location.
5. The app will begin calculating the route and showing directions on the screen. Depending on the settings of your navigation app and your vehicle, you may receive voice instructions to guide you to your destination.
6. If you want to change your route or navigation settings, you can use the on-screen buttons or voice search to make changes.
7. When you approach your POI, the app can suggest a parking spot, if there is one.
8. When you arrive at the location, the app will notify you that you have reached your POI.  -->

### Map markers

To use [markers](../personal/markers.md#overview) in CarPlay for navigation, they need to be added in advance in the OsmAnd app on your device, tablet or phone, and they need to be available in the *Menu → Map marker* list.   

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-3.png)


### Address search

With this option you can search for the necessary places on the map to navigate. For convenience, you can search by different categories.  
- [Address search](../search/search-address.md) - enter the needed address in the search field.
- [POI search](../search/search-poi.md) - search by Point of Interest names.
- [Custom search](../search/custom-poi-search.md) - search by the categories you created.
- [History search](../search/search-history.md) - displays your whole search history.
- Coordinate search - suggests different formats of coordinates.  

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-search.png)


### Favorites

Favorites is one of the functions of OsmAnd that allows the user to make a kind of bookmark (note) on the map. While using CarPlay you cannot add or modify Favourites, only use existing ones. The list of [Favorites](../personal/favorites.md#manage-favorites) can be found in the OsmAnd app *Menu → My Places → Favorites*. If you want to use them for navigation, configure everything you need before connecting the device to your vehicle's multimedia system.  

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-favorites.png)  ![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-favorites-last-modified.png)


### Tracks

:::tip
Do not choose tracks that are obviously far away from your current location. It can take a long time to get to the starting point of the track.
:::

From the list of tracks available in *Menu → My Places → [Tracks](../personal/tracks.md)*, you can select the necessary one in CarPlay or on the device connected to the vehicle's multimedia system and the route will either build up to the start of the track or display the current direction along the track.   

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-tracks.png)  ![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-tracks-mod.png)   ![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-tracks-rec.png) 


## Navigation

Through the *Navigation* menu in Car Play, you can select the end point of the route, without any ability to add intermediate destinations.  

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-navigation.png)


### Voice prompts

In OsmAnd, you can set up [voice prompts](../navigation/voice-navigation) separately for one selected profile or for all profiles at once. Do this before starting a route on your device, tablet or phone. CarPlay does not have a function to set up voice prompts. 


### Screen Alert widget

This [widget](../widgets/nav-widgets.md#alert-widget) combines alert types such as **Pedestrian crosswalks** and **Speed Limit**.  
You can set them up by going to *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_settings,configure_profile,routing_settings_2,screen_alerts"/>*.

## 2.5D view

## Volume control

In most cases, all signals remain at constant full volume, separate from the audio playback settings at the same time. To change the volume of the OsmAnd navigation prompts when using CarPlay, go to *Setup → Voice → Voice volume* on the vehicle's multimedia system screen.  
If this method does not work, there is another option. To adjust the notification volume, you need to turn on Siri during a call. Hold down the button on the steering wheel that turns on Siri, and during the call, adjust the volume using the dashboard or steering wheel.  


## Multifunction dashboard

The Car Play dashboard will soon be able to display and use the OsmAnd navigation app at the same time as music, messages or other notification apps.  


## Fixes issues with voice control

Choose which speakers to use.
- On your phone or tablet, turn on Bluetooth.
- Pair your phone or tablet to your car.
- Set the source for your car's audio system to Bluetooth.
    - On your Android phone or tablet, open the Google Maps app Maps.
    - Tap your profile picture or initial Account Circle and then Settings Settings and then Navigation settings.
    - Choose an option:
       - To hear navigation from your car speakers, turn on Play voice over Bluetooth.
       - To hear navigation from your phone or tablet’s speaker, turn off Play voice over Bluetooth.
