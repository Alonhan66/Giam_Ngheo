## Overview

:::tip NOTE
CarPlay is [paid feature](../purchases/ios.md#free-and-paid-features) of the OsmAnd app.
:::

OsmAnd is available for [*CarPlay*](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/) functions in your vehicle. You can connect your iOS device to the vehicle's multimedia system screen and use OsmAnd to navigate.  

<!--
## Setup

First, you need to select and configure the profile to be used when connecting to Android Auto or CarPlay. You can read how to configure a profile in the article [Profiles (Settings)](../personal/profiles).  

:::note
For quick access to the list of profiles available for connecting to CarPlay, the iOS version of the OsmAnd app has a separate item *Menu → Settings → OsmAnd Settings → CarPlay Profile*.  
:::

For OsmAnd to work, you need to connect your iOS device to the vehicle's multimedia system.  
- Not all vehicles support device connection capability. Check the [list for CarPlay](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/).
- You need to have an OsmAnd Pro subscription. Check it here *Menu → Settings → Purchases*.
- To find out how to connect and set up your device, please visit the [**CarPlay**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205634) websites. 
- Once connected, an icon with the OsmAnd logo and name will appear among the available programs in the menu on the selected platform.
- You will then be able to start the navigation or use the OsmAnd search function in CarPlay.

## Interaction with the map

Most OsmAnd settings directly related to navigation are available in CarPlay. Interaction with the map is limited to *My Location* and *Zoom*. 


### Search

With this option you can search for the necessary places on the map to navigate. For convenience, you can search by different categories.  
- [Address search](../search/search-address.md) - enter the needed address in the search field.
- [POI search](../search/search-poi.md) - search by Point of Interest names.
- [Custom search](../search/custom-poi-search.md) - search by the categories you created.
- [History search](../search/search-history.md) - displays your whole search history.
- Coordinate search - suggests different formats of coordinates.

### POI

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-5.png)


### Favorites

Favorites is one of the functions of OsmAnd that allows the user to make a kind of bookmark (note) on the map. While using CarPlay you cannot add or modify Favourites, only use existing ones. The list of [Favorites](../personal/favorites.md#manage-favorites) can be found in the OsmAnd app *Menu → My Places → Favorites*. If you want to use them for navigation, configure everything you need before connecting the device to your vehicle's multimedia system.

### Markers

To use [markers](../personal/markers.md#overview) in CarPlay for navigation, they need to be added in advance in the OsmAnd app on your device, tablet or phone, and they need to be available in the *Menu → Map marker* list.

### Tracks

:::tip
Do not choose tracks that are obviously far away from your current location. It can take a long time to get to the starting point of the track.
:::

From the list of tracks available in *Menu → My Places → [Tracks](../personal/tracks.md)*, you can select the necessary one in CarPlay or on the device connected to the vehicle's multimedia system and the route will either build up to the start of the track or display the current direction along the track.

-->
## Navigation

Through the *Navigation* menu in Car Play, you can select the end point of the route, without any ability to add intermediate destinations.


### Voice prompts

In OsmAnd, you can set up [voice prompts](../navigation/voice-navigation) separately for one selected profile or for all profiles at once. Do this before starting a route on your device, tablet or phone. CarPlay does not have a function to set up voice prompts. 


### Screen Alert widget

This [widget](../widgets/nav-widgets.md#alert-widget) combines alert types such as **Pedestrian crosswalks** and **Speed Limit**.  
You can set them up by going to *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_settings,configure_profile,routing_settings_2,screen_alerts"/>*.  

![CarPlay screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/car-play-13.png)  


## Volume control

By default, all prompts remain at a constant full volume, separate from simultaneous audio playback. To change the volume of the OsmAnd navigation prompts when using CarPlay, go to Setup → Voice → Voice volume on the vehicle's multimedia system screen. 
If this method does not work, there is another option. To adjust the notification volume, you need to turn on Siri or Google Assistant during a call. Hold down the button on the steering wheel that turns on Siri or Google Assistant, and during the call, adjust the volume using the dashboard or steering wheel.
