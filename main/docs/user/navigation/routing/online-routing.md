## Overview

Online routing is a powerful tool that can help users save time and navigate more efficiently. However, it's important to note that online routing relies on internet connectivity, and may not be available in areas with poor or no network coverage. Additionally, users should always exercise caution and use their judgment when following any route suggested by an online routing service.

## Route parameters - Online routing

*Online routing* can be enabled in [Navigation type](../../navigation/navigation-settings.md#overview) section of the Navigation settings of the selected *Profile*. In OsmAnd there are two predefined *online routing engines* ([ZLZK](https://zlzk.biz/) and [OSM DE](https://routing.openstreetmap.de)), that provide three *Online routing* types : *Bicycle, Car, On foot*.  

:::note
Online routing types are designed for *Driving, Cycling, Walking* profiles, although they can also be used with other OsmAnd profiles (Truck, Motorcycle, Skiing, Horseback riding). They are provided â€œas is", so you can't customize them according to your needs using different navigation options.
