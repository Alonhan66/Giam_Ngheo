## Overview

Online routing is a powerful tool that can help users save time and navigate more efficiently.  
However, it's important to note that online routing relies on internet connectivity, and may not be available in areas with poor or no network coverage. Additionally, users should always exercise caution and use their judgment when following any route suggested by an online routing service.

Online routing in OsmAnd can be used for a wide range of activities, including driving, walking and cycling.
