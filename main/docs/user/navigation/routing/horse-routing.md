## Horseback routing

Horse routing can be useful for horse riders who want to explore new areas and plan their rides in advance. With horse routing in OsmAnd, users can access detailed maps, plan routes, and navigate safely while enjoying the beauty of nature.  


### Horseback routing settings

Horse routing in OsmAnd is a feature that allows users to plan and navigate horseback riding routes using the OsmAnd mobile app. This feature is designed to provide equestrians with information about horse-friendly paths, bridleways, and other suitable routes for horse riding.

The horse routing feature takes into account the width of the path, the surface type, and other factors that can affect the safety and comfort of the horse and rider. It also provides information about horse-friendly accommodations, such as stables, watering points, and other facilities that may be necessary during a long ride.
