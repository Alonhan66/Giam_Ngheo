## Overview  

The routing type determines how the route will be calculated. The OsmAnd app uses different routing types for hiking, cycling, skiing or boating routes. Each profile has a specific type of routing assigned to it, which, however, you can change according to your needs: *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,configure_profile"/> (<Translate android="true" ids="app_mode_boat"/>, <Translate android="true" ids="app_mode_car"/>, <Translate android="true" ids="app_mode_pedestrian"/> or another one) â†’ <Translate android="true" ids="routing_settings_2,nav_type_hint"/>*.

The following profiles (with their own routing types) are available by default: *Driving, Cycling, Walking, Truck, Motorcycle, Public transport, Boat, Aircraft, Skiing, Horseback riding*.  

:::note  
*Truck, Motorcycle, Moped, Aircraft and Horseback riding* profiles are switched off by default. You need to activate these profiles.  
*Direct-to-point* navigation type doesn't have its own profile.

## Offline OsmAnd Routing

Offline OsmAnd routing is based on OpenStreetMap data and provides variety of routes for different purposes. This is a list of predefined routing types which could be extended. The navigation rules are contained in [routing.xml](../../../technical/osmand-file-formats/osmand-routing-xml.md) file and are used for offline routing. The route type changes automatically, when you change your profile.  
**You can also create your [own routing.xml file](#custom-routing) and use it for navigation (only for advanced OsmAnd users).**  

- [Car routing (Truck, Motorcycle)](./car-based-routing.md) - OsmAnd provides driving instructions for  drivers of Cars, Trucks and Motorcycles.  
- [Bicycle  routing (MTB)](./bicycle-based-routing.md) - Bicycle routing provides navigation prompts specifically for cyclists and mtb enthusiasts. It can also be used by moped (scooter) drivers.  
- [Pedestrian routing](./pedestrian-routing.md) - Pedestrian routing can be used not only for walking around the city, but also during hiking trips.
- [Moped routing](./moped-routing.md) - Moped routing is based on the bicycle routing, though it has it's own features.
- [Public Transport routing](./public-transport-navigation.md) - Public Transport navigation can help you while traveling around the city.
- [Horseback routing](./horse-routing.md) - Horse routing provides equestrians with tools they need to plan and enjoy their horseback riding activities.  
- [Skiing routing](./ski-routing.md) - Ski routing allows users to plan and navigate ski tours and other winter sports activities using the OsmAnd mobile app.  
- [Boat routing](./boat-navigation.md) - Boat routing can be used to build a route on rivers, channels, small lakes and in the open sea but only when fairways are marked in OpenStreetMap.

### Avoid specific roads

[Select roads](../../map/map-context-menu.md#avoid-road) on map to avoid

### Avoid temporary closures

*Consider temporary limitations* option allows to take into account temporary road restrictions or closures when calculating routes. They may include things like road construction, special events, or road closures due to accidents or weather conditions. These limitations may not be reflected in the standard map data used by OsmAnd, so enabling this option allows the app to provide more accurate and up-to-date routing information.

When this option is enabled, OsmAnd will attempt to retrieve information about temporary road restrictions from various sources, such as traffic reports, road authorities, or user reports. It will then use this information to adjust the route calculation accordingly, taking into account any relevant temporary limitations.

Note that enabling this option may increase the amount of data used by the app and may also affect the speed of route calculation. However, if you are driving in an area where temporary road restrictions are likely, enabling this option can help you avoid unexpected detours or delays.

### Customize offline routing

You can modify _routing.xml file_ for your own needs. It means that you can update the routing algorithm according to your preferences.  
More info about this possibility you may find in [Technical documentation](../../../technical/osmand-file-formats/osmand-routing-xml.md) and on [OsmAnd Github page](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml).  

- To change the [routing.xml](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml) file, you first need to copy it. Read the [Help information](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml#L25) carefully. [OsmAnd user's routing.xml](https://groups.google.com/g/osmand/c/JvV7p_JJvEU) file for an example.
- To add a new *routing.xml* file to OsmAnd, just tap on the file and choose to open it in the OsmAnd app.
- Select the [Navigation type](../../navigation/setup/route-navigation.md#type-of-navigation) for your profile.

### Development settings

| Parameter | Description | Note |
|:------------|:---------------|
| *<Translate android="true" ids="use_live_routing"/>*  | Allows to use OsmAnd Live updates while routing. Note, that we recommend to use this option for testing purposes only. |   
| *<Translate android="true" ids="use_two_phase_routing"/>*  | You can use <Translate android="true" ids="complex_routing_descr"/> |  
| *<Translate android="true" ids="use_fast_recalculation"/>* | <Translate android="true" ids="use_fast_recalculation_desc"/>  |  

## Direct to point

- *[Straight line routing](./straight-line-routing.md)* - Provides a straight line routing (or "point-to-point" navigation) which is recalculated if location is far away from straight line.  
- *[Direct-to-point routing](./direct-to-point-routing.md)* - Provides a straight line routing (or "point-to-point" navigation) which stays stable for whole navigation in contrast to **Straight line** routing (route recalculation is disabled).

## Other Routing types

- *[Online routing](./online-routing.md)* - Online routing is an OsmAnd feature that allows users to plan and navigate routes using online services.  
- *[BRouter routing](./brouter.md)* - BRouter app can be used for offline routing.
