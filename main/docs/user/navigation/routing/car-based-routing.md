Car routing takes into account factors such as road types, speed limits, traffic, and other driving restrictions such as one-way streets or turn restrictions, to help drivers find the most efficient and direct routes to their destinations. It also helps drivers avoid roads that are not suitable for cars, such as narrow roads or roads with weight restrictions.

Truck routing is similar to car routing, but is designed specifically for drivers of large commercial vehicles. It takes into account additional factors such as vehicle height, weight, and width restrictions, as well as information about road types and inclines that may be difficult for trucks to navigate. This helps truck drivers find the most suitable and efficient routes to their destinations, while avoiding roads that may be unsafe or inaccessible for their vehicles.

Moto routing is designed for motorbike riders and takes into account factors such as winding roads, scenic routes, and other features that may be appealing to motorcycle enthusiasts. It also takes into account the unique needs of motorbike riders, such as the ability to filter through traffic and the importance of avoiding roads with poor road conditions.

Overall, car, truck, and moto routing features in OsmAnd are designed to help drivers navigate efficiently, safely, and comfortably, by providing tailored directions that take into account the unique needs and preferences of each driver and vehicle type. This can help drivers save time, fuel, and avoid traffic congestion or other hazards on the road.
