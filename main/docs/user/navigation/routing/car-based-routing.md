### Overview

[Car](#car-routing-features), [truck](#truck-routing-features), and [motorcycle](#motorcycle-routing-features) routing features are designed to help drivers navigate efficiently, safely, and comfortably, by providing tailored directions that take into account the unique needs and preferences of each driver. This can help drivers save time, fuel, and avoid hazards on the road.

### Car routing settings

Car routing takes into account road types, speed limits, and other driving restrictions (one-way streets, ban on turns, etc.). It is designed to help drivers find the most efficient and direct routes to their destinations. It also helps avoid roads that are not suitable for cars, such as narrow roads or roads with weight restrictions.

### Truck routing settings

Truck routing is similar to car routing, but is designed specifically for drivers of large commercial vehicles. It takes into account additional factors such as vehicle height, weight, and width restrictions, as well as information about road types and inclines that may be difficult for trucks to navigate. This helps truck drivers find the most suitable and efficient routes to their destinations, while avoiding roads that may be unsafe or inaccessible for their vehicles.
