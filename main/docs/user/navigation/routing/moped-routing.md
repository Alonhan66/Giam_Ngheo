## Overview

*Moped routing* allows drivers to build an optimal route, taking into account the specifics of driving a vehicle such as a moped or scooter. The routing process considers various factors for safe, comfortable, and legal movement on roads or bicycle paths.

*Moped routing* can be configured according to your needs in the [Route parameters section](../../navigation/navigation-settings.md#navigation-type--route-parameters) of the Navigation settings.  
## Route parameters - Moped

The moped's rooting settings are very simple and consist of just a few options.

| Parameter | Description | Note |
|:------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| *<Translate android="true" ids="impassable_road"/>* |  <details><summary> Select roads you want to avoid during navigation.  </summary>![Avoid roads Android](@site/static/img/navigation/routing/avoid_moped_android.png) </details>  | You can either [select a road on the map](../../map/map-context-menu/#avoid-road) or choose road type(s) from the list:  <ul><li>[<Translate android="true" ids="routing_attr_avoid_ferries_name"/>](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Ferries) (a type of water transportation, that carries  vehicles across bodies of water)</li></ul>|
| *<Translate android="true" ids="routing_attr_allow_private_name"/>* |  Private access restrictions will be ignored when route calculating.  | Tag *[private](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access)* is used in OSM to describe restrictions on the use of highways and other transportation routes, as well as buildings, entrances, amenities, and leisure entities.   |

Other routing settings:  
- The routing algorithm can take into account temporary limitations specified in OpenStreetMap. This can be done by using *[<Translate android="true" ids="temporary_conditional_routing"/>](./index.md#avoid-temporary-closures)* option. Note that in some cases, the information from OSM may be outdated. 
- In the [Recalculate route section](../route-navigation.md#route-recalculation) of the Route parameters, you can enable and adjust route recalculation options.
- *[<Translate android="true" ids="default_speed_setting_title"/>](../navigation-settings.md#default-speed)* (Android) or *[<Translate ios="true" ids="road_speeds"/>](../navigation-settings.md#default-speed)* (iOS) should be set according to your vehicle parameters. They are used to determine whether the road can be used for routing.
- In the [Development section](../routing/index.md#development-settings) of the Route parameters (**Android only**), you can try new routing features, that are under testing now. Note, that these settings are only available when the [OsmAnd development plugin](../../plugins/development.md) is enabled.
