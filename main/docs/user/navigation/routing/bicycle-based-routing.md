### Overview

Bicycle routing takes into account factors like bike paths, trails, and roads that are safe and legal for cyclists to ride on, as well as other factors such as elevation changes and pedestrian traffic.

### Bicycle routing features

Bicycle routing is especially important because it is designed to help cyclists plan and navigate routes that are optimized for their needs. For example, cyclists may want to avoid busy roads or steep hills, and instead opt for quieter routes with less traffic and gentler slopes. OsmAnd's bicycle routing feature allows cyclists to input their starting and ending points, and then generates a route that takes into account their preferences and the local geography.

### MTB routing features

The MTB (Mountain Bike) routing feature in OsmAnd is similar to bicycle routing, but is specifically designed for off-road riding on rough terrain. It takes into account factors such as unpaved roads, gravel paths, and steep inclines, and helps riders find the safest and most enjoyable routes for their mountain biking adventures.

### Moped routing features
