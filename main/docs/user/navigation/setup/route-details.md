## Route Details

In the OsmAnd app, you can find detailed information about the whole route, analyze it on the map, add or delete information on route segments, print the route plan, save the route and share it.

There are three ways to access the Route Details menu:  
1. Go to the main *Menu → Navigation*, set the route, and press the Details button.
2. Tap the Navigation icon on the map screen, set the route, and tap the Details button.
3. Go to the My Places menu, tap any available track in the list *Menu → My Places → Tracks*, select the Navigation icon in the track context menu in the Overview, and tap Details.
