## Overview

:::tip NOTE
Android Auto is [paid feature](../purchases/android.md#free-and-paid-features) of the OsmAnd app.
:::

OsmAnd is available for [*Android Auto*](https://www.android.com/auto) functions in your vehicle. You can connect your Android or iOS device to the vehicle's multimedia system screen and use OsmAnd to navigate.  

![Android Auto screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/osmand_android_auto.png)  


## Setup

First, you need to select and configure the profile to be used when connecting to Android Auto or CarPlay. You can read how to configure a profile in the article [Profiles (Settings)](../personal/profiles).   

For OsmAnd to work, you need to connect your Android device to the vehicle's multimedia system.  
- Not all vehicles support device connection capability. Check the [list for Android Auto](https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/).
- You need to have an OsmAnd Pro, OsmAnd+ or Maps+ subscription. Check it here *Menu → Settings → Purchases*.
- To find out how to connect and set up your device, please visit the [**Android Auto**](https://support.google.com/androidauto/answer/6348029?hl=en) websites. 
- Once connected, an icon with the OsmAnd logo and name will appear among the available programs in the menu on the selected platform.
- You will then be able to start the navigation or use the OsmAnd search function in Android Auto.

## Interaction with the map

Most OsmAnd settings directly related to navigation are available in Android Auto. Interaction with the map is limited to *My Location* and *Zoom*. Android Auto also has the *[Compass](../widgets/map-buttons.md#compass)* widget. The rest of the settings are focused on getting the end point for the route on the map.


### Search

With this option you can search for the necessary places on the map to navigate. For convenience, you can search by different categories.  
- [Address search](../search/search-address.md) - enter the needed address in the search field.
- [POI search](../search/search-poi.md) - search by Point of Interest names.
- [Custom search](../search/custom-poi-search.md) - search by the categories you created.
- [History search](../search/search-history.md) - displays your whole search history.
- Coordinate search - suggests different formats of coordinates.

### Favorites

Favorites is one of the functions of OsmAnd that allows the user to make a kind of bookmark (note) on the map. While using Android Auto you cannot add or modify Favourites, only use existing ones. The list of [Favorites](../personal/favorites.md#manage-favorites) can be found in the OsmAnd app *Menu → My Places → Favorites*. If you want to use them for navigation, configure everything you need before connecting the device to your vehicle's multimedia system.

### Markers

To use [markers](../personal/markers.md#overview) in Android Auto for navigation, they need to be added in advance in the OsmAnd app on your device, tablet or phone, and they need to be available in the *Menu → Map marker* list.

### Tracks

:::tip
Do not choose tracks that are obviously far away from your current location. It can take a long time to get to the starting point of the track.
:::

From the list of tracks available in *Menu → My Places → [Tracks](../personal/tracks.md)*, you can select the necessary one in Android Auto or on the device connected to the vehicle's multimedia system and the route will either build up to the start of the track or display the current direction along the track.  

![Android Auto screen](@site/static/img/navigation/auto-car/android-auto-6.png)


## Navigation

Through the *Settings* menu in Android Auto you can select the end point of the route, without any ability to add intermediate destinations.


### Voice prompts

In OsmAnd, you can set up [voice prompts](../navigation/voice-navigation) separately for one selected profile or for all profiles at once. Do this before starting a route on your device, tablet or phone. In Android Auto, the only setting available is to disable or enable all selected voice prompts at the same time.

### Screen Alert widget

This [widget](../widgets/nav-widgets.md#alert-widget) combines alert types such as **Pedestrian crosswalks** and **Speed Limit**.  
You can set them up by going to *<Translate android="true" ids="shared_string_menu,shared_string_settings,configure_profile,routing_settings_2,screen_alerts"/>*.
