## Overview

*Search History* is a record of all searches and locations that you have entered or searched for in the app over the period of use. This tool allows you to easily find and access previously searched locations, which makes navigation easier and saves time.   

OsmAnd provides several ways to view your search history.  

- The [Search button](../widgets/map-buttons.md#search) is always displayed on the map, and tapping it will take you to the tool's [general screen](#how-to-use).
- Go to the main Android *Menu → Search → History tab*.
- When preparing to start a route, tap *Navigation → Set destination → Search field*.
- Information block in the navigation menu of [route preparation](../navigation/setup/route-navigation.md#navigation-menu) displays a list of recent destination points, which are also part of the search history.
- Search history is available in [Android Auto](../navigation/auto-car.md#search) and [CarPlay](../navigation/car-play.md#search).

<!--
1. Re-search: Users can use the Search History to re-search for previously searched locations or addresses without having to enter the query again. This saves time and effort when searching for locations.

2 Quick access to frequently visited places: If the user frequents certain places like home, work or favorite places, the Search History can save these places and provide quick access to them without having to search every time.

Tracking previous trips: Search History can be useful for tracking previous trips and itineraries. This can be useful for retrieving routes that the user has taken before, or for scheduling trips based on previous experiences.

4. Searching for places at a specific time or date: If the user has searched for places or addresses at a specific time or date, Search History can help reconstruct those searches for later use or analysis.

5. Deletion and management of records: Search History also provides the ability to delete or manage previous records, which can be useful for maintaining privacy or organizing history.

In general, Search History in the navigation application serves to enhance user experience, improve search and navigation efficiency, and preserve and provide relevant information about a user's previous actions.

Key features of Search History include:

1. query storage: The app stores text queries entered by the user and the locations that were found as a result of the search.
2. Date and Time: Each query in the history is usually accompanied by the date and time when it was executed. This helps users keep track of when they searched for certain places or routes.
3. Ease of Use: Search History provides a simple interface for viewing, filtering, and deleting previous searches, making it easy to use.
4. Frequently Visited Places: The app can also automatically save places that the user frequently visits to provide quick access to them in the future without having to search again.
5. Privacy: It is important to protect the personal data of users, so navigation applications usually provide an option to delete all or individual records from the Search History.

### Search query list

Display **order in the list**:
- **Recent Items**. The most recent requests or locations are displayed at the top of the list. This allows quick access to recently used items.
- **Chronological order**. Items in the Search History list are arranged in chronological order, starting with the oldest or earliest entries and ending with the most recent or latest. Old items gradually move down the list as new entries are added, unless old items in the search history have been used, in which case they will be moved to the top of the list.

The following **types of objects** get into the Search History list:
- **Locations**. This can be an address, business name, route number, coordinates, markers, points of interest, OSM notes, or other such places that the user has searched tapped on the map.
- **Text Querie**. These are text strings that the user types into the search box to find a specific place or address, and then taps on them to browse. For example, *Restaurants downtown* or *Nearest gas station*.
- **Tracks and Waypoints**.
