## Overview

*Search History* is a record of all searches and locations that you have entered or searched for in the app over the period of use. This tool allows you to easily find and access previously searched locations, which makes navigation easier and saves time.   

OsmAnd provides several ways to view your search history.  

- The [Search button](../widgets/map-buttons.md#search) is always displayed on the map, and tapping it will take you to the tool's [general screen](#how-to-use).
- Go to the main Android *Menu → Search → History tab*.
- When preparing to start a route, tap *Navigation → Set destination → Search field*.
- Information block in the navigation menu of [route preparation](../navigation/setup/route-navigation.md#navigation-menu) displays a list of recent destination points, which are also part of the search history.
- Search history is available in [Android Auto](../navigation/auto-car.md#search) and [CarPlay](../navigation/car-play.md#search).

Key features of Search History include:

1. query storage: The app stores text queries entered by the user and the locations that were found as a result of the search.
2. Date and Time: Each query in the history is usually accompanied by the date and time when it was executed. This helps users keep track of when they searched for certain places or routes.
3. Ease of Use: Search History provides a simple interface for viewing, filtering, and deleting previous searches, making it easy to use.
4. Frequently Visited Places: The app can also automatically save places that the user frequently visits to provide quick access to them in the future without having to search again.
5. Privacy: It is important to protect the personal data of users, so navigation applications usually provide an option to delete all or individual records from the Search History.
