# Create new rendering style

Creating new rendering style is possible without any change in the program. Style definitions could be difficult if you want to write it from scratch for example Nautical style or Default style (15K lines of code). It is advised to create a dependent style so you could change start changing style by small pieces. For example UniRS style contains mostly color redefinition and icon appearance.

To test rendering style you could use OsmAndMapCreator. In case you would like to use in the OsmAnd on device. You need to put the xml definition of the style into folder on sdcard ('rendering') next to other rendering styles.

All rights on the style is created belongs to the author. Though these rights could not be applied to the OsmAnd binaries and .
