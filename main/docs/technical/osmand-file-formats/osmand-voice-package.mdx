# Voice packages

<IncompleteArticle/>

OsmAnd supports 2 type of voice packages: **Text-To-Speech** (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech) available on App Stores or preinstalled and **Recorded Voice packages** (which include recorded voices).

If you couldn't find the voice package you need, please follow examples and create your own voice package. Examples - https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/voice, [de_0.voice.zip](https://download.osmand.net/download?standard=yes&file=de_0.voice.zip), [en_0.voice.zip](https://download.osmand.net/download?standard=yes&file=en_0.voice.zip).

### Difference between TTS and Recorded pckages

- Text To Speech engine supports Street Name, Refs, POI names pronouncation
- All Text to Speech supported packages bundled and updated with an application
- Recorded Packages needs to be installed and updated manually (though configuration file could be updated with app update)
- Recorded Packages may not support some correct forms and support is limited
- Recorded Packages don't require any proprietary TTS engine to be installed

### Package Structure

Voice package usually is distributed as .voice.zip, where zip contains 1 folder with [lang_tts.js](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/voice/de/de_tts.js) (main **configuration** file) and sound files if they are present. 

Configuration files are written in JavaScript language. All configuration files are by default TTS-packages, even if there is no TTS present yet to support the language. And later the configuration is extended by mapping 'dictionary phrases' to 'recorded file names'.

```
function populateDictionary(tts) {
	// ROUTE CALCULATED
	dictionary["route_is1"] = tts ? "Die berechnete Strecke ist" : "route_is1.ogg";
	dictionary["route_is2"] = tts ? "lang" : "route_is2.ogg";
	dictionary["route_calculate"] = tts ? "Route neu berechnet" : "route_calculate.ogg";
	dictionary["distance"] = tts ? "die Entfernung beträgt" : "distance.ogg";

	// LEFT/RIGHT
	dictionary["prepare"] = tts ? "Demnächst " : "prepare.ogg";  // Demnächst sounds better then Vorbereiten zum
	dictionary["after"] = tts ? "nach" : "after.ogg";
	
	dictionary["left"] = tts ? "links abbiegen" : "left.ogg";
  .....
}

function route_recalc(dist, seconds) {
	return dictionary["route_calculate"] + (tts ? ", " : " ") + distance(dist, "nominativ") + (tts ? ", " : " ") + dictionary["time"] + " " + time(seconds) + (tts ? ". " : " ");
}
```


### Generation custom package

Please checkout [resources project](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/) and use the same folder structure as [German package](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/voice/de) - simply make copy. Once it's done you can change, run [generation script](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/voice/gen_voice.sh#L4) and specify needed arguments. Help is inside the script.

### Testing voice package (Android)

For testing it's possible to use Navigation or Navigation simulation or handy version of [Development plugin](/docs/user/navigation/voice-navigation#testing-of-voice-prompts-android) which simulates different voice commands to be tested.
