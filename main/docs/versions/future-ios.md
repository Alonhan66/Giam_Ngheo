## Redesign Tracks menu


We've completely redesigned the [_Tracks menu_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks#my-places-menu) in [_My Places_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/myplaces). 

![My Places > Tracks menu iOS](../../blog/2024-03-06-ios-4-7/img/my_places_tracks_menu_ios.png)

_New track_ allows to start [_Trip recording_](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/trip-recording) action. Just click _"Start recording"_ button. During the recording, you can view the Recording track data, including distance, duration, and the number of waypoints. There are two key actions available during recording: _Stop record_ and _Save GPX track_.
